# snake-game
This is a game of snake I made with the raylib OpenGL wrapper library. I used Imgui for debugging mostly. This is one of my first projects so everything is a mess, hopefully I get better.
I made each part of the snake with a linked list data structure since my professor said those are important. I also made it more of a bullet hell instead of just plain snake where you try not to hit your own tail.
It's kind of fun.
